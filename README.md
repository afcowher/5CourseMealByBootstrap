# Adam Cowher - 5 Course Meal, By Bootstrap
## I first utilized Bootstrap classes by ensuring that the first 3 food items all fit on the first row when the window is full screen. To do this I ensured that each column in the first row equaled 12 units total and gave each one a different background color to better signify them. For each food image, I utilized the Bootstrap class "img-fluid" so that when the window becomes resized so too do the images concerning the column and row they're in. When resizing windows I ensured that once the window is small enough that users can see each recipe item broken into 1-by-1 columns for better visibility. For the second row in the container, I had the "Entree" and "Dessert" sections span the entirety of the row while pushing the button below the columns. This was to make sure the button wasn't taking up a considerable amount of space considering it is just a simple link button.
